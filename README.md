# Next.js & NextAuth & Tailwind Netflix Clone

In this project i used Tailwind.css for the styling and NextAuth to create an authentication functionality.
I cloned the Netflix landing page and integrated Google authentication. 

## Note!
to use the authentication, a GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET has to be provided which are obviously not within this repo.
